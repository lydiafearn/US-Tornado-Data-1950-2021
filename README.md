# US-Tornado-Data-1950-2021

Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms and they frequently occur in the United States. 
Most that are experienced are small and in rural locations, however, occassionally they can lead to great destruction. 

This project will analyse the tornadoes that have occurred between 1950 and 2021 in the US. The dataset provides information on the date which the tornado occurred, the state it occurred in and details of its magnitude, injuries, deaths and exact longitude and latitude. 

In this repository you can find the python scripts I conducted as part of my analysis.
